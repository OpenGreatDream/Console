## History: Why I develop this repository?

By chance, I used Windows Console as my 2D renderer in a console game(text-based) gamejam in January 2018.

In These years I have studied Unity, UE4. I master C# and know well C/C++. I always come back to are C/C++, Windows Console.

I spent a lot of time researching Windows Console, Win32API, C/C++, C#, 3D Math. I have checked a lot of ConsoleGameEngine repos in github.com. I have also tried to write them myself, but after many times, I'm still not satisfied, I always want to do more!

During this research I find the Windows console has great potential beyond your imagination!

About 1 week ago, I wanted to restart and create a awesome Console library and share my skills with Windows Console.

Make some intresting stuffs.

No hate, only fast code and bugs.
